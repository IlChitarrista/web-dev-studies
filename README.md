# Web Dev Studies
This will be a way for me to keep track of my progress with Web Development and Programming in General
## Scope
This is just a way for me to organize my studies and it won't feature anything remotely useful in a real project although it might be of inspiration to some. I'm studying FullStack Development so this repository will be very varied in content and any issue reporting with suggestions is appreciated.
## How to run
I will soon create a main website from which to access all projects, it's all going to be hosted here on Github.
